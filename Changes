    - Replaced {Alphabetic} with {IsAlphabetic} in regular expressions for
      compatibility with Perl 5.6.2.

    - Minor improvements to the documentation.

1.02 3 Nov 2009
  - Changed required perl version to 5.8.0 or greater (from 5.6.2); could
      not get code to compile in 5.6.2 due to use of parsing of unicode
      characters in regular expressions.
